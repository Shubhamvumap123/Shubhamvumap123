## 2024-05-23 - [Heroku Cold Starts in Profile README]
**Learning:** Using `herokuapp.com` for dynamic SVG generation in GitHub Profile READMEs can lead to significant loading delays due to Heroku's free tier cold starts. This results in broken images or slow load times for visitors.
**Action:** Use `readme-typing-svg.demolab.com` instead of `herokuapp.com` for better reliability and performance.
