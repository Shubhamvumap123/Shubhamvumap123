## 2024-05-22 - Dynamic SVG Accessibility & Reliability
**Learning:** `readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com` is unstable; `demolab.com` is the reliable alternative. Dynamic SVGs in GitHub Profiles often lack descriptive alt text, making them invisible to screen readers.
**Action:** Always check dynamic SVG URLs for reliability and add descriptive alt text (e.g., "Typing Animation: [Content]") instead of generic "Typing SVG".
